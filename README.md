In the U.S. telecom industry, including big names like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint, about 1.9% of their 400 million subscribers decide to switch carriers. While this might not seem like a huge number, it matters financially. These companies spend a whopping $10.39 billion to get new customers, but they lose about $780 million each year due to customers leaving. That means the money lost from customers leaving is much less (about 1/13th) than what they spend to get new ones. So, keeping customers happy and staying with the company turns out to be a smarter and more cost-effective move.

The research methodology involved exploratory data analysis, missing value detection, and identification of important features, model performance, and final model selection. The dataset has 21 variables and 7043 observations. Various statistical tests and visualizations were employed to understand feature importance and correlations. Five machine learning models were selected.

The study demonstrated that logistic regression(accuracy: 80%) performed well compared to other complex models, aligning with the emphasis on interpretability in informing strategic decisions in customer relationship management.
